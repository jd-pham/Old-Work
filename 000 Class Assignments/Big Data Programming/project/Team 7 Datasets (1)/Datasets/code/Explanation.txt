Each of these files should produce their own output folder for the cleaned dataset that they produce. Cargo Theft, Hate Crime, and Human trafficking were recorded on a 
per incident basis, so I had to merge similar row values accordingly, usually based a set of shared attributes (City / County, State, Offense / Number of offenders).

For NIBRS, I had to merge all their tables together into a single excel sheet (2012 - 2020), while keeping the population relatively the same. I opted to take the average
of the area's population. For other numerical values, they are the sum of all years stored into a single row / column. Many of NIBRS' crime columns were cut off because
I thought that it would look messy in the final visualization.

To run the code, they require the necessary datasets; nibrs datasets must have their own folder within the same directory as the code that is being run while the other three 
(cargo, hate, human) must be in the same folder as the code. I have provided them in case you need / want to run them.

The NIBRS folder is the exact same as the one provided in the parent directory.
